## Submission 

Submitted to [Transactions on Software Engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=32).



## Experiment Replication

To reproduce the experiment results, execute `runner.sh` in directory `experiments`, the performance results will be created in directory `result_experiments`. The result files include two performance measurements (please see paper for details), `metric0` stands for Magnitude of the Relative Error, `metric1` stands for SA (Standardized Accuracy).

To get the scott-knott test results of experiments, execute `sk_stats.py` by typing `cat name.txt| python2 sk_stats.py --text 30 --latex True`, this will output a latex-friendly scott-knott charts for this specific `.txt` file. The actually output will look like this:

Note that `sk_stats.py` in this program currently only supports python 2.7.
